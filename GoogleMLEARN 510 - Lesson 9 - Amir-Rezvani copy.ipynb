    "### Add Discussion here:\n",
    "**Comparison of Decomposition Plots:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Additive Decomposition:** In the additive decomposition plot, the seasonal component exhibits a roughly constant amplitude over time. The trend component shows a clear upward movement. The residuals in the additive model might still show some pattern or increasing variance if the seasonality's strength is proportional to the level of the series.\n",
    "*   **Multiplicative Decomposition:** In the multiplicative decomposition plot, the seasonal component's amplitude appears to increase over time, proportional to the increasing trend. This is a key characteristic: as the passenger numbers go up, the seasonal variations also become larger in magnitude. The trend component also shows an upward movement. The residuals in a well-suited multiplicative model should appear more random (homoscedastic) than in an additive model if the original series has multiplicative seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison of Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test P-values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The ADF test is used to check for stationarity. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the time series is non-stationary (has a unit root). A low p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests rejecting H0, meaning the series is likely stationary.\n",
    "*   If the p-value for the residuals of the multiplicative decomposition is lower than that of the additive decomposition, it would suggest that the multiplicative model does a better job of capturing the underlying structure, leaving residuals that are closer to white noise (and thus more stationary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which decomposition makes more sense for this dataset? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the airline passenger dataset, **multiplicative decomposition generally makes more sense.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Nature of Seasonality:** The airline passenger data typically shows that seasonal fluctuations (e.g., summer peaks) are larger when the overall passenger volume is higher. This means the seasonal effect is proportional to the level of the series, which is characteristic of a multiplicative relationship (Trend * Seasonality * Residuals).\n",
    "    *   If we look at the `additive_decomposition.png` (hypothetically, as I can't see it), we'd expect the seasonal swings to be roughly the same size in the early years as in the later years. \n",
    "    *   Conversely, in `multiplicative_decomposition.png`, the seasonal plot should show swings that grow larger as the trend increases. This visual cue is often very telling for the airline dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Stationarity of Residuals:** The goal of decomposition is to isolate the predictable components (trend and seasonality) and leave behind residuals that are as close to stationary white noise as possible. \n",
    "    *   If the multiplicative model is more appropriate, its residuals will typically be more stationary (i.e., have a more constant mean and variance, and no predictable patterns) than the residuals from an additive model. \n",
    "    *   A lower p-value from the ADF test on the multiplicative model's residuals would support this. For example, if the p-value for multiplicative residuals is < 0.05 and the p-value for additive residuals is > 0.05 (or simply higher), it indicates the multiplicative residuals are more stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Value of Decompositions and Stationarity:** Decomposition helps in understanding the underlying patterns of a time series. By separating trend and seasonality, we can analyze them individually. The residuals represent what's left over. If the residuals are stationary, it implies that the systematic components of the series have been well-captured by the model. Many time series models (like ARIMA) assume or perform better on stationary data. Therefore, transforming a non-stationary series into a stationary one (or stationary residuals) through techniques like differencing or decomposition is a crucial step before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the increasing amplitude of seasonal swings in the airline passenger data strongly suggests a multiplicative model. This should be reflected in more random-looking residuals and potentially a lower ADF p-value for the residuals of the multiplicative decomposition compared to the additive one, indicating better achievement of stationarity in the residuals."

    "    *   *RMSE:* `best_rmse` (e.g., likely > 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES):**\n",
    "    *   *Expected RMSE:* Significantly better than SES, as HWES can model trend and seasonality.\n",
    "    *   *Best Configuration:* (e.g., Trend='mul', Seasonal='mul', Seasonal Periods=12)\n",
    "    *   *RMSE:* `best_hw_rmse` (e.g., potentially in the 20-50 range, often good for this dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Autoregressive (AR) Model - ARIMA(p,0,0):**\n",
    "    *   *Expected RMSE:* Performance can vary. May not be as good as HWES if strong seasonality isn't captured well by AR terms alone without differencing or seasonal components.\n",
    "    *   *Best `p` found:* `best_p_ar` (e.g., around 10-15, from range 10-22)\n",
    "    *   *RMSE:* `best_ar_rmse` (e.g., perhaps 70-100)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model - ARIMA(p,0,q):**\n",
    "    *   *Expected RMSE:* Potentially an improvement over AR if MA terms help model the error structure.\n",
    "    *   *Best `p` (from AR), `q` found:* `p_arma`, `best_q_arma` (e.g., q around 10-15, from range 10-22)\n",
    "    *   *RMSE:* `best_arma_rmse` (e.g., perhaps 60-90)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model - ARIMA(p,d,q):**\n",
    "    *   *Expected RMSE:* Should improve on ARMA if differencing (`d`) helps to make the series stationary.\n",
    "    *   *Best `p` (from AR), `d`, `q` (from ARMA) found:* `p_arima`, `best_d_arima` (0,1, or 2), `q_arima`\n",
    "    *   *RMSE:* `best_arima_rmse` (e.g., potentially 40-70 if d=1 or d=2 is effective)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Best Performing Model:** Typically, for the airline passenger dataset, **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES)** with multiplicative trend and multiplicative seasonality (e.g., `trend='mul'`, `seasonal='mul'`, `seasonal_periods=12`) performs very well. This is because the dataset exhibits a clear trend and strong seasonality, where the seasonal fluctuations increase with the level of the series (multiplicative nature).\n",
    "    Another strong contender can be a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA), which is not explicitly tested here but is an extension of ARIMA. An ARIMA(p,d,q) model, especially if `d > 0`, can also perform well by handling non-stationarity. If `best_arima_rmse` is close to or better than `best_hw_rmse`, it would indicate its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reasons for Performance:**\n",
    "    *   **SES** is too simple for this data as it cannot capture trend or seasonality, leading to poor forecasts.\n",
    "    *   **AR, ARMA, and ARIMA** models capture dependencies on past values and past errors. ARIMA's integration component (`d`) helps in making the series stationary, which is crucial for these models. However, standard ARIMA doesn't explicitly model seasonality in the same direct way HWES does. To get similar performance from ARIMA-family models for highly seasonal data, one would usually employ SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), which adds seasonal AR, I, and MA components.\n",
    "    *   **HWES** directly models level, trend, and seasonality. The multiplicative versions are particularly suited for data where the seasonal pattern's magnitude grows with the trend, which is characteristic of the airline data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Characteristics of Airline Passenger Data Captured:**\n",
    "    *   **Trend:** The data shows a clear upward trend in passenger numbers over time. HWES (with 'add' or 'mul' trend) and ARIMA (with differencing 'd'>0) can capture this.\n",
    "    *   **Seasonality:** There's a strong yearly seasonality (e.g., peaks in summer). HWES (with 'add' or 'mul' seasonality and `seasonal_periods=12`) directly models this. ARIMA models would need seasonal orders (SARIMA) to capture this effectively, though high `p` or `q` values in a standard ARIMA might implicitly capture some seasonality, often less effectively.\n",
    "    *   **Multiplicative Nature:** As passenger numbers increase, the seasonal variations also tend to become larger. Multiplicative HWES is designed for this. For ARIMA models, a log transformation of the data before modeling is a common technique to stabilize variance and turn a multiplicative relationship into an additive one, which can then be better handled by ARIMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "While the exact RMSE values will be known after running the notebook, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing is expected to be one of the top performers due to its explicit and effective handling of the trend and multiplicative seasonality present in the airline passenger dataset. ARIMA models, especially with appropriate differencing, can also provide good results, but for strong seasonality, a SARIMA extension would likely be superior to the basic ARIMA explored."
